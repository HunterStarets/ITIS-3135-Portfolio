        <p>
          Quizlet.com is a website that provides users the tools to create and
          study custom digital flashcards, quizzes, and study guides. It is
          popular among students of all ages and subjects.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> effectively uses contrast to make the
            most important information on the website stand out. For example,
            the website uses a combination of bold and regular text to
            distinguish between headings and body text, and it also uses color
            to highlight key information such as buttons and links.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repetition:</strong> uses repetition to create a consistent
            visual design throughout the website. For example, the website uses
            the same font, color scheme, and layout on all of its pages, which
            helps users quickly recognize and navigate the site.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alignment:</strong> effectively aligns its elements to
            create a clean and organized look. For example, the website uses a
            grid-based layout that aligns all of its elements and creates a
            sense of order on the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity:</strong> uses proximity to group related elements
            together and create a clear visual hierarchy on the page. For
            example, the website groups related elements such as navigation
            links and search bars together, which makes it easier for users to
            find what they're looking for.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="amisdubeauceron.org">amisdubeauceron.org</a></h3>
        <p>
          The website is a hot mess! The colors are ugly, the text is hard to
          read, and the layout is all over the place.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> The color scheme is inconsistent and
            harsh on the eyes. The font color and background color sometimes
            lack contrast, making it difficult to read the text.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repetition:</strong> There is little repetition in the
            layout or typography, making the site feel disorganized and
            confusing. The use of different font sizes and styles throughout the
            site is inconsistent and makes it harder to read.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alignment:</strong> The site lacks a clear visual hierarchy
            and the alignment of elements is inconsistent, making it hard for
            users to identify the most important information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity:</strong> There is a lack of clear grouping and
            spacing between elements, making it harder to distinguish between
            different sections of the site.
