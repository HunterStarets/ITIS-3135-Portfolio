                    <h2>Rugby Basics</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Rugby is a fast-paced and exciting team sport that combines elements of speed, strength, and
                        strategy. If you're new to rugby or just want to brush up on the basics, here's a brief overview
                        of some key concepts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Players and Positions:</strong> A rugby team consists of 15 players (in the Rugby
                            Union) or 13 players (in the Rugby League). There are two main categories of players:
                            forwards (who focus on winning possession and gaining territory) and backs (who are
                            responsible for creating and executing attacking plays).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Scoring:</strong> Points can be scored through tries (touching the ball down in the
                            opponent's in-goal area, worth 5 points), conversions (a kick through the goalposts after a
                            try, worth 2 points), penalty goals (kicking the ball through the goalposts after a penalty,
                            worth 3 points), and drop goals (a field goal, worth 3 points).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Rugby matches are divided into two halves, each lasting 40
                            minutes. The game begins with a kick-off, and the team that can maintain possession, advance
                            down the field, and score points wins. Players must pass the ball backward or sideways, but
                            they can kick the ball forward to advance down the field.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rucks and Mauls:</strong> When a player is tackled and brought to the ground, a ruck
                            forms as players from both teams compete for possession of the ball. Mauls occur when a
                            player carrying the ball is held up by the opposition, and teammates join in to push the
                            ball carrier forward.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Set Pieces:</strong> Scrums and lineouts are used to restart play after certain
                            stoppages, such as knock-ons or forward passes. Scrums involve eight players from each team
                            pushing against each other to win possession of the ball, while lineouts involve players
                            lifting teammates into the air to catch a thrown-in ball.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
