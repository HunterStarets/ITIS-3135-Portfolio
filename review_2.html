            unique/standalone/embedded one</h4>

        <p class="red">Yes, all of the styles are in the styles.css</p>

        <h4>c. <strong>CRAP</strong></h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Contrast
                <ul>
                    <li class="red">The website has a good contrast between background color and the text color, making
                        the content easily readable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Repetition
                <ul>
                    <li class="red">The font is consistently used throughout the website. Consistent font-sizes, such as
                        1.2em for links and 1.5em for headings, also maintain a consistent visual appeal.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Alignment
                <ul>
                    <li class="red">Many elements, such as headings (h2, h3) and footer, are centrally aligned, creating
                        a balanced and organized appearance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Proximity
                <ul>
                    <li class="red">Related elements are placed closely together, such as navigation menus and their
                        dropdowns, while unrelated elements are separated with padding and margins, which enhances the
                        site's overall organization and visual hierarchy.
                    </li>
                </ul>
