## ITIS 3135 Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio for my Web Development (ITIS 3135) class at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Each page represents a different class assignment, showcasing my progression of skills and my understanding of web design practices. This is my first formal introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Archive Notice

This class has ended, therefore this repository is archived, and I will no longer be making updates to it.
