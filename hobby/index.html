            <p>
                My name is Hunter Starets, and I am a 20-year-old athlete who has been training in strength sports
                for the past couple years. In late March, I will participate in my first official powerlifting meet.
                For this meet, I have been focused on optimizing my training to achieve the best possible results
                since December. As a 90kg athlete with USPA, I was first introduced to powerlifting by my friend
                Chris, who has already made a name for himself in the sport. Chris offered to coach me for my first
                meet, and since then, we have continued to work together. My goal is to push myself to see what I am
                capable of achieving and to continue learning how to improve my performance in powerlifting.
            </p>

            <p>Powerlifting is a strength sport that involves lifting the maximum weight possible for three
                different exercises: squat, bench press, and deadlift. The goal is to achieve the highest total
                weight lifted across all three exercises, with each lift judged by judges to ensure proper form and
                technique.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy powerlifting because it challenges me both physically and mentally. It pushes me to see
                what I am capable of achieving and helps me to stay disciplined and focused. My long-term goal is to
                achieve a 1500lbs total, which would require significant dedication and hard work. I am excited to
                continue pushing myself and to learn more about this amazing sport.

            <h2>Training Schedule</h2>
            <p>
                My powerlifting training involves 5 days a week in the gym. Four of those days are intense and
                challenge me both physically and mentally, while the fifth day is an easier session to maintain
                blood flow in my muscles.</p>
            <p>
                My coach provides me with a weekly training plan based on my goals for meet day and my performance
                over the past few weeks. He prescribes different variations of the squat, bench press, and deadlift,
                along with varying rep ranges, weight ranges, and the number of sets to complete for each exercise
                on a given day. His knowledge and experience help him to create these customized plans.</p>
            <p>
                At the end of each week, we discuss my progress and address any weak points for the following week.
            </p>
            <h3>Weekly Training Schedule</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday:</strong> Squat, then bench press, then accessories</li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Deadlift, then bench press, then accessories</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Accessory exercises</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday:</strong> Squat, then accessories</li>
                <li><strong>Friday:</strong> Deadlift, then bench press, then accessories</li>
                <li><strong>Saturday and Sunday:</strong> Rest days</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I prefer to lift for longer sessions on fewer days per week, rather than lifting heavy six times a
                week for shorter workouts. Accessories are exercises that are less intensive but help to improve the
                strength of the muscles required for squatting, bench pressing, and deadlifting.

            <p>
                I train at Olympus 365, which is a well-equipped gym with a strong sense of community. The
                powerlifting area features top-of-the-line equipment and the members are very knowledgeable about
                powerlifting, making it a great environment to learn and grow as an athlete.
            </p>
            <h3>Equipment Available</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Three Competition bench/combo racks (two ER Equipment racks, one StrongArm)</li>
                <li>Two BoS power racks with safety straps and monolift attachment</li>
                <li>Calibrated Steel Kilo Plates by Eleiko, Rogue, and Vulcan</li>
                <li>Texas Power Bars, Texas Deadlift Bar, EliteFTS Safety Squat Yoke Bar, multiple specialty bars
                </li>

                The gym has a strong sense of community, and I have found that the members are very knowledgeable
                about powerlifting. As a relatively new athlete, I feel that I can learn something new every day
                from my interactions with the other members.

            <h2>How We Train</h2>
            <p>
                The conjugate method is a popular strength training program that involves rotating through
                different exercises over a period of time. This allows athletes to focus on different muscle
                groups and develop a well-rounded level of strength. The program typically includes both max
                effort work (lifting heavy weights for low reps) and dynamic effort work (lifting lighter
                weights for higher reps at a faster pace).
            </p>
            <p>
                One aspect of the conjugate method is the use of banded and chain work for speed. Bands and
                chains are used to add resistance to the barbell at the top of the movement where the
                athlete is strongest. This allows them to work on explosiveness and speed through the entire
                range of motion. As the bar moves away from the athlete, the resistance from the bands or
                chains decreases, making it easier to complete the lift. The goal is to use a weight that is
                challenging but allows the athlete to maintain proper form and perform the lift with speed
                and explosiveness.</p>

            <h2>Why We Powerlift</h2>
            <p>
                Powerlifting is a challenging and rewarding sport that I enjoy because of the physical and mental
                benefits it provides. It pushes me to constantly improve my strength and technique, and the feeling
                of accomplishment after a successful lift is unparalleled.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been inspired by many great athletes in the sport, including my friend Chris who first
                introduced me to powerlifting. Seeing his dedication and hard work has motivated me to strive for
                greatness in my own training. Being part of a supportive community of powerlifters has also been a
                great source of inspiration and motivation for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, powerlifting has had a positive impact on my life and I am excited to continue pushing
                myself to see what I am capable of achieving in the sport.
