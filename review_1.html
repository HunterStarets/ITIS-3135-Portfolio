        <h3>Your submission leads right to the page to be reviewed (or if instructed the primary page with links to the
            page, or both)</h3>

        <p class="red">Yes, the submission leads right to the home page</p>

        <h3>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc..</h3>

        <p class="red">All of the naming conventions are up to par</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>

        <h4>a. Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read</h4>

        <p class="red"> Yes, I really like the colors</p>

        <h4>b. Page has site colors and fonts using the standard css file, unless this assignment requires a
            unique/standalone/embedded one</h4>

        <p class="red">Yes, each page links to a default.css in the styles folder, and a second css file specific to
            that page if
            necessary.</p>

        <h4>c. <strong>CRAP</strong></h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Contrast
                <ul>
                    <li class="red">The contrast between the dark background color and the text color makes it easy for
                        users to
                        read the content. Additionally, the website employs various shades of tan and brown for
                        different elements, creating visual hierarchy and separating different sections of the webpage
                        effectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Repetition
                <ul>
                    <li class="red">The website demonstrates consistency in styling by using the Times New Roman
                        throughout the
                        website. Additionally, consistent padding, border-radius values, and button hover effects help
                        create a coherent visual language that guides users intuitively.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Alignment
                <ul>
                    <li class="red">The website is designed with a structured layout, using flexbox and grid for
                        positioning
                        elements. Main content, navigation, and form elements are centered, while text within the body
                        is left-aligned. This consistent alignment creates an orderly appearance and improves
                        readability.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Proximity
                <ul>
                    <li class="red">The website employs appropriate spacing, padding, and margin values for elements
                        such as
                        navigation items, form fields, and buttons. This helps in grouping related content and ensures a
                        visually organized layout, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with the website.
                    </li>
